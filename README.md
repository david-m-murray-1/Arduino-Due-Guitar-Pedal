# Arduino-Due-Guitar-Pedal

ARDUINO DUE 24-bit resolution guitar pedal.
I2S comm. with Cirrus CS4271 audio codec. 
48 kHz sampling rate.
Linearly normalized across samples.
Circularly buffered. 


Nearly finished with the accompanying pedal shield schematic.
TODO: Clamper to provide negative voltage swing for the opamp's output.
TODO: Ultiboard footprints for parts: 3x POTs, 2x Jacks

TODO: 96kHz sampling rate.
PWM clock set to 96khz.  Change Crystal.

TODO: 2-channel true analog bypass. test impedance against digital bypass.
