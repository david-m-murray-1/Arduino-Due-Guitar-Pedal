I2S comm. with Cirrus CS4271 audio codec. 
96 kHz sampling rate.
Linearly normalized across all samples.
Dynamically scaled, logarithmic output (dB).
Circularly buffered.

Sine table for flanger.

TODO: test analog output buffers. cannot use negative voltage rails with arduino.

TODO: Metal casing for guitar pedal.

TODO: Glass casing for guitar pedal.

TODO: Test Hardware interface. Test codec for 48 kHz and 96 kHz.
